# 🤖 Recommendation Logic

The recommendation engine uses a simple hybrid filtering approach.

### Input

User Skills:

```text
React
JavaScript
Node.js
```

User Interests:

```text
Web Development
AI
```

### Course Data

Course Category:

```text
Web Development
```

Course Tags:

```text
React
Frontend
JavaScript
```

### Recommendation Process

1. Fetch user skills
2. Fetch user interests
3. Fetch all courses
4. Compare:

* User skills ↔ Course tags
* User interests ↔ Course category

5. Return matching courses

### Example

User:

```text
Skills:
React

Interests:
AI
```

Recommended Courses:

```text
React Mastery
AI Fundamentals
Full Stack Development
```
